    description: '`animated-value` is an **imperative animation API for declarative UI renderers**, like React, Preact, and Torus. It allows us to build rich, fully interactive animations with the full benefits of a JavaScript-driven imperative animation system -- custom tweening and physics including spring-based interactive physics, full interruptibility and redirectability, reliable chaining and callbacks, and more -- within the robust declarative UI frameworks we use to build apps today.
